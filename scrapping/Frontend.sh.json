        "A frontend developer is a professional who uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and build the visual and interactive elements of websites and applications that users engage with directly. They ensure the interface is responsive, accessible, and visually appealing. Every feature you see and interact with on a website (like buttons, menus, and animations) is created by a frontend developer.",
        "While this is not a complete frontend developer job description, the following can be considered as a great introduction to the role of a frontend developer: you'll be responsible for creating the user interface of a website to ensure it looks good and is easy to use, with great focus on design principles and user experience. You'll be working closely with designers, back-end developers, and project managers to make sure the final product meets the client's needs and provides the best possible experience for the end-users.",
        "The easy part about the frontend development role is that there arenât that many options to choose from when it comes to frontend languages and technologies (unlike with backend development).",
        "As a frontend developer, youâll be working with the following technologies:",
        "HTML: The markup language used to create the skeleton of the page. All the information you want to show on a webpage will be laid out through HTML.",
        "CSS: The Cascading Style Sheet language allows you to adjust the way in which the HTML elements are rendered, improving the visuals of your webpage.",
        "JavaScript: This is the de facto programming language for frontend development, and it allows you to add dynamism to your websites/web apps. There is an alternative known as TypeScript, which is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that you can use instead. However, in that scenario, youâd have to set up a transpiler to translate your code into JavaScript before being able to run it in the browser.",
        "The main skills required to become a frontend developer are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The rest are also important, but without those three basic ones, you canât apply any of the others.",
        "The full list of frontend developer skills you should look into if youâre hoping to up your game is the following:",
        "1. Understanding the core technologies: HTML, CSS & JavaScript.2. Understanding accessibility: Knowing how it can affect your users' experience.3. Version control systems: Be familiar with tools like Git.4. Responsive design: Implementing designs that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.5. User experience (UX): Understanding the basics of UX principles.6. SEO: Knowing how search engine optimization works and how you can leverage it in your code.7. RESTful APIs: Understanding the basics of RESTful APIs and how to consume them.8. Testing and debugging: Implementing testing practices and debugging effectively.9. Dev tools: Master the browserâs developer tools for inspecting, debugging, and optimizing code.10. Frameworks: Having a go-to frontend framework (like React or Vue) and understanding others at a high level.11. Web performance: Understanding web performance optimizations and core web vitals.12. TypeScript: Understanding how TypeScript works and when to use it.",
        "Covering these basic skills will prepare you for any type of frontend developer interview questions you might encounter in the future and will enhance your current role.",
        "Do frontend developers really code? The answer is yes, absolutely.",
        "The fact that frontend developers are full-time developers who produce an output that is visually appealing (thanks to the designs provided by others) sometimes confuses others, making them believe that frontend developers arenât really coding. However, that couldnât be further from the truth.",
        "As a frontend developer, youâll be coding all the time.",
        "While in some companies, the frontend developer is also a skilled designer or UX engineer, those are not the typical profiles. As a frontend dev, your learning focus should be coding-related (i.e coding best practices, software design patterns, frontend architecture, etc).",
